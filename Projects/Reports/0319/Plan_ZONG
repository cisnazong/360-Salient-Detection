1. Continue finetuning of PiCANet
2. Comparison with SCRN/Basnet
3. Watch files of H264,H265, etc
4. Research of Segmentation methode
5. Design experiments of different 360 to equi-rectangular methodes: 
    1. Change better dataset of 360 graphs
    2. Transform 360 dataset to 2d in traning process, then output 2d to 360 
    3. Use 2d dataset in training process, then in predicting process, 360-2d input, 2d-360 output
